Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

Part 1
Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Start by finding the most recent date in the data set.
Using this date, retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data by querying the 12 preceding months of data. 
Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.
Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
Design a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?).
Calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperature of the most active station.
Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).
Plot the results as a histogram.

Part 2
Design a Flask API based on the queries that developed in part 1.
